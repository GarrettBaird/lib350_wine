**California Wine – A Visual History**

**Data Management Plan**

**Project Description**

The collections’ theme will encapsulate the production, storage, and consumption of wine within California. With California being one of the premiere wine producers in the United States, being able to see a historical progression of how the vineyards, technology, and social gatherings surrounding wine allow us to better understand the importance of the wine industry held within California. This collection is hosted on CollectionBuilder, an open-source platform that allows users to create and share digital collections. We are using it to organize and display the photographs and their associated metadata. The collection will consist of still frame photographs of important vineyards, tools used in the creation of wine, the barrels used to house the wine, and the social gatherings that were directly linked to wine. The photographs themselves will be collected and documented from GLAMS (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) such as the California Digital Library, The Sonoma County Library, UC Davis, and other digital collections. The audience for this collection is targeted for those who are interested in the historical development of wine in the California area such as historians and vintner. By examining the differences in technique, storage, vineyards, and equipment, we will be able to better understand what made California wines so popular.

**Anticipated Data**

The data was collected by searching through various GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) online libraries and digital collections. We focused on four primary sources: the UC Berkeley Library, UC Davis Library, UC San Diego Library, and the Sonoma County Library. These collections provided a good range of photographs documenting the history of wine production, storage, and consumption in California.

**Documentation and Metadata**

The project will include metadata for each photograph, documenting key information such as the object id, filename, date, source, description, and more. This metadata will be stored in a spreadsheet on Google Sheets, which will be publicly accessible via a shared link. Users can access and view the metadata directly from Google Sheets, where they can access and download the data as needed.

In addition to the Google Sheets document, the metadata will also be integrated into the CollectionBuilder site. CollectionBuilder allows for easy access to metadata through its interface, where users can view, search, and filter the metadata directly alongside the images. A data dictionary will also be provided to help users understand the terms and fields used in the metadata. The data dictionary will be available on the CollectionBuilder site.

**Storage and Backup**

The project’s metadata, images, and all other files will be stored in a few different places to make sure everything is accessible and backed up. We will be using CollectionBuilder hosted by GitHub, but for cloud storage, we’ll use Google Drive to keep backups of everything and make sure the files are readily available. On top of that, we’ll keep a local backup of all the project files on our personal computers, just in case something were to happen with the cloud storage.

**Data Sharing**

The data will be shared publicly on CollectionBuilder site, where users can access and download the photographs and metadata. The metadata and documentation will also be available via Google Sheets or GitHub for easy reference.

**Period of Data Retention**

After the project is submitted for grading, we don’t plan to actively maintain it. However, the data will remain publicly accessible on CollectionBuilder and Google Sheets for those who wish to explore or reuse it.

**Licensing and Ethical Issues**

The materials for this project, including the photos and metadata, are all from public GLAM collections, so the use of these materials is subject to the terms outlined by the respective library. Some materials are in the Public Domain, while others are In Copyright \- Non-Commercial Use Permitted.
