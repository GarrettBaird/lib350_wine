# Desciption
The collections’ theme will encapsulate the production, storage, and consumption of wine within California. With California being one of the premiere wine producers in the United States, being able to see a historical progression of how the vineyards, technology, and social gatherings surrounding wine allow us better understanding the importance of the wine industry held within California. The collection will consist of still frame photographs of important vineyards, tools used in the creation of wine, the barrels used to house the wine, and the social gatherings that were directly linked to wine. The photographs themselves will be collected and documented from GLAMS such as the California Digital Library, The Soma County Library, UC Davis, and other digital collections.  
	The audience for the collection is targeted for those who are interested in the historical development of wine in the California area such as historians and vintner. By examining the differences in technique, storage, vineyards, and equipment, we’ll be better able to understand what has made Californian wines so popular.
